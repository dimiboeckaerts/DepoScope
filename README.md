# DepoScope - Predict and annotate phage depolymerases

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A2XJ_oUtlmIfU3XXmev5dzJUNxqR6VV9?usp=sharing)

## General information

This is the repository related to our manuscript *DepoScope: accurate phage depolymerase annotation and domain delineation using large language models*, published in PLOS Computational Biology.

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started with DepoScope to predict depolymerases from your phage genomes or genes is to run the Google Colab that we provide [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A2XJ_oUtlmIfU3XXmev5dzJUNxqR6VV9?usp=sharing). You only need a zip file of your phage genomes to get started! Alternatively, go to the the `scripts_clean` folder and run the `VII.DpoDetectionTool.ipynb` notebook.

To run the benchmarking against other depolymerase detection tools, go to the `benchmark` folder and run the `benchmark_notebook.ipynb`notebook.
